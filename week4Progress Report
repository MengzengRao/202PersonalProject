Week 4 is not as productive as week 3. Mainly because the project deadline was pushed back so much and feel no urgency finishing the project
in week 4. Week 4 is mainly focus on coding this project. However, I was stuck on the test 3, but did not keep working on coding. I will cathc
up next week and try to finish this project in week 6. two weeks ahead of the deadline.
